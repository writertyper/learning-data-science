# A Path to Data Science

This is a book to track my learning as a data scientist. Everyday we will run some examples and learn together. We can do this.


It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.
